# textools

Textools is a collection of tools to perform common text analysis operations in R. It is essentialy a convenience wrapper for consolidate functions included in well-known packages like quanteda, FactoMineR, factoextra, among others. Its main aim is simply to shorten the code and save time when performing common text analyses such as clustering, correspondence analysis, and text cleaning operations, for instance by including in the same function the preprocessing steps (e.g. the creation of a document-term-matrix) and the analysis itself. It include also a lemmatizer based on Tree Tagger and koRpus that works on multiple language including Italian. The package is a work in progress.
